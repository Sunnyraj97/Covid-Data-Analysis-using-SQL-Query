# SQL Query Covid-data-exploration

To further sharpen my SQL skills, i took on this project having obatined data from a reliable source - ourworldindata.org I imported the data after converting it to an excel workbook from a comma separated file (csv) to my SQL database And i analyzed covid-19 deaths per continent grouping them by the same attribute in some queries. Through my analysis, i discovered that North America and closely followed by South America had the largest death count, and the least being Oceania.
